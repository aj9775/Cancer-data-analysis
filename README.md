This is a data science repository where in we first scrape the United States Deaprtment of Health Cancer <b>website https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/</b>.
We go through most of the cancer types and scrape the data available there into multiple excel files based on the type of data.
We then clean the data and do some basic data analysis on them.
We use Jupyter Notebook to do all the tasks. We make use of python with various libraries like BeautifulSoup for webscrapping, pandas, numpy, matplotLib and Seaborn for charts.
